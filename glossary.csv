"Absolute brightness ","absolute magnitude","
    A measure of the true brightness of an object. The absolute brightness or magnitude of an object is the apparent brightness or magnitude it would have if it were located exactly 32.6 light-years (10 parsecs) away. For example, the apparent brightness of our Sun is much greater than that of the star Rigel in the constellation Orion because it is so close to us. However, if both objects were placed at the same distance from us, Rigel would appear much brighter than our Sun because its absolute brightness is much larger.

"
Absorption,,"
    The process by which light transfers its energy to matter. For example, a gas cloud can absorb starlight that passes through it. After the starlight passes through the cloud, dark lines called absorption lines appear in the starâs continuous spectrum at wavelengths corresponding to the light-absorbing elements.



"
"Absorption line",,"
    A dark line in a continuous spectrum caused by absorption of light. Each chemical element emits and absorbs radiated energy at specific wavelengths, making it possible to identify the elements present in the atmosphere of a star or other celestial body by analyzing which absorption lines are present.




"

The ACS wavelength range spans from ultraviolet to near-infrared light. The cameras sharp eye and broader viewing area allow astronomers to study the life cycles of galaxies in the remotest regions of the universe. Astronauts installed the camera aboard the telescope in March 2002, but the camera experienced an electrical short in 2007 that shut down all but one data channel.

The afterglow is usually extremely faint, making it difficult to locate and study.

"
Altitude-azimuth,,"
    A type of telescope mounting that supports the weight of the telescope and allows it to move in two directions to locate a specific target. One axis of support is vertical (called the altitude) and allows the telescope to move up and down. The other axis is horizontal (called the azimuth) and allows the telescope to swing in a circle parallel to the ground. This makes it easy to position the telescope: swing it around in a circle and then lift it to the target. However, tracking an object as the Earth turns is more complicated. The telescope needs to be adjusted in both directions while tracking, which requires a computer to control the telescope.

During Hubbleâs sunlight or daytime period, the solar arrays provide power to the onboard electrical equipment. The solar arrays also charge the spacecraftâs batteries so they can power the spacecraft during the night portion of Hubbleâs orbit. Hubble has six nickel-hydrogen batteries.

"
Electron,,"
    A substance composed of a particular kind of atom. All   atoms with the same number of protons (atomic numbers) in the nucleus are examples   of the same element and have identical chemical properties.

The atoms of a particular element have the same number of protons in the nucleus   and exhibit a unique set of chemical properties. There are about 90 naturally   occurring elements on Earth.

    When Hubble reaches the end of its mission, NASA must be able to safely return the telescope to Earth. When that time comes, the space shuttle will no longer be operating, so another means of capturing the telescope must be available.
