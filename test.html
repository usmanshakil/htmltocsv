<div class="section_title">Absolute brightness (absolute magnitude)</div>
<div class="section_content sub_divider">
    A measure of the true brightness of an object. The absolute brightness or magnitude of an object is the apparent brightness or magnitude it would have if it were located exactly 32.6 light-years (10 parsecs) away. For example, the apparent brightness of our Sun is much greater than that of the star Rigel in the constellation Orion because it is so close to us. However, if both objects were placed at the same distance from us, Rigel would appear much brighter than our Sun because its absolute brightness is much larger.
    

    
</div>
<div class="section_title">Absolute zero</div>
<div class="section_content sub_divider">
    The coldest possible temperature, at which all molecular motion stops. On the Kelvin temperature scale, this temperature is the zero-point (0 K), which is equivalent to -273°C and -460°F.
    
    

    
</div>
<div class="section_title">Absorption</div>
<div class="section_content sub_divider">
    The process by which light transfers its energy to matter. For example, a gas cloud can absorb starlight that passes through it. After the starlight passes through the cloud, dark lines called absorption lines appear in the star’s continuous spectrum at wavelengths corresponding to the light-absorbing elements.
    

    
</div>
<div class="section_title">Absorption line</div>
<div class="section_content sub_divider">
    A dark line in a continuous spectrum caused by absorption of light.

<div class="section_title">Advanced Camera For Surveys (ACS)</div>
<div class="section_content sub_divider">
    An optical camera aboard the Hubble Space Telescope that uses CCD detectors to make images. The camera covers twice the area, has twice the sharpness, and is up to 10 times more efficient than the telescopes Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2. The ACS wavelength range spans from ultraviolet to near-infrared light. The cameras sharp eye and broader viewing area allow astronomers to study the life cycles of galaxies in the remotest regions of the universe. Astronauts installed the camera aboard the telescope in March 2002, but the camera experienced an electrical short in 2007 that shut down all but one data channel. During Servicing Mission 4 in 2009, astronauts replaced the failed circuit boards and added a new power supply box to restore power to the camera.

<div class="section_content sub_divider">
    The fading fireball of a gamma-ray burst – a sudden burst of gamma rays from deep space – that is observable in less energetic wavelengths, such as X-ray, optical, and radio. After an initial explosion, an expanding gamma-ray burst slows and sweeps up surrounding material, generating the afterglow, which is visible for several weeks or months. The afterglow is usually extremely faint, making it difficult to locate and study.

<div class="section_title">Altitude-azimuth</div>
<div class="section_content sub_divider">
    A type of telescope mounting that supports the weight of the telescope and allows it to move in two directions to locate a specific target. One axis of support is vertical (called the altitude) and allows the telescope to move up and down. The other axis is horizontal (called the azimuth) and allows the telescope to swing in a circle parallel to the ground. This makes it easy to position the telescope: swing it around in a circle and then lift it to the target. However, tracking an object as the Earth turns is more complicated. The telescope needs to be adjusted in both directions while tracking, which requires a computer to control the telescope.

<div class="section_content sub_divider">
    Mathematically expresses the idea that the recessional velocities of faraway galaxies are directly proportional to their distance from us. Hubble’s Law describes the relationship of velocity and distance by the equation V = H<sub>o</sub> * d, where V is the object’s recessional velocity, d is the distance to the object, and H<sub>o</sub> is the Hubble constant. Essentially, the more distant two galaxies are from each other, the faster they are traveling away from each other. American astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered this relationship in 1929 when he observed that galaxies and clusters of galaxies were generally moving away from each other.

<div class="section_title">White dwarf star</div>
<div class="section_content sub_divider">
    The hot, compact remains of a low-mass star like our Sun that has exhausted its sources of fuel for thermonuclear fusion. White dwarf stars are generally about the size of the Earth.

<div class="section_title">Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2   (WFPC2)</div>
<div class="section_content sub_divider">
    The Hubble Space Telescopes workhorse instrument, WFPC2 snapped high-resolution images of faraway objects. Its 48 filters allowed scientists to study precise wavelengths of light and to sense a range of wavelengths from ultraviolet to near-infrared light. The instruments four CCDs (charge-coupled devices) collected information from stars and galaxies to make photographs. WFPC2 was installed aboard the Hubble telescope during the December 1993 servicing mission and was replaced by Wide Field Camera 3 in 2009 during Servicing Mission 4.

<div class="section_title">Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3)</div>
<div class="section_content sub_divider">
    This new camera replaced the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 during Servicing Mission 4. WFC3 has the latest CCD (charge-coupled device) technology and optical coatings which provide a broader range of colors, spanning ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared wavelengths. WFC3 will greatly enhance Hubble's observational capabilities by studying a diverse range of objects and phenomena, from early and distant galaxy formation to nearby planetary nebulae, and finally our own backyard – the planets and other bodies of our solar system.

<div class="section_title">Wide Field / Planetary Camera (WF/PC)</div>
<div class="section_content sub_divider">
    A collection of eight separate, yet interconnected, cameras originally used as the main optical instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope. Four cameras were used in tandem to observe in either wide-field, low-resolution mode or narrow-field, high-resolution (planetary) mode. The Wide Field and Planetary Camera2 replaced the WF/PC during the December 1993 servicing mission.

<div class="section_title">X-power</div>
<div class="section_content sub_divider">
    Identifies the magnifying power of a lens or mirror. For example, a 50-power telescope makes the image 50 times larger than it is when viewed without the telescope.

<div class="section_title">X-rays</div>
<div class="section_content sub_divider">
    The part of the electromagnetic spectrum with energy between ultraviolet light and gamma rays. X-rays are used in medicine to detect broken bones and cavities in teeth. Astronomers can detect X-rays from exploding stars and black holes.
    
    

    
</div>
<div class="section_title">X-ray sources</div>
<div class="section_content sub_divider">
    Celestial objects that give off X-rays. These exotic objects are producing very energetic radiation and include black holes, neutron stars (pulsars), supernovae remnants, and the centers of galaxies.
    
    

    
</div>
<div class="section_title">X-ray telescope</div>
<div class="section_content sub_divider">
    A special telescope used to detect X-rays – high-energy electromagnetic radiation. The high energy of X-rays means they will go through rather than bounce off a “normal” telescope mirror. Instead, the mirrors are arranged so the X-rays skip across them much like a stone skips across the surface of a lake.

<div class="section_title">Zenith</div>
<div class="section_content ">
    The point on the celestial sphere that is directly above   the observer. Holding a balloon overhead places the balloon at your zenith.   Although celestial objects appear to rise and set as they move across the sky,   they rarely reach the zenith point.
